    "message_diversao_diariobrix": [
        "Day 47 - Today Vinicius left for work earlier and I stayed home taking care of the house. I found one of his socks under the sofa and took it to the bedroom door‚Ä¶ but I think he didn‚Äôt even notice. I wrote down that the smell of the sock changes from day to day: sometimes it smells like the street, sometimes like soap. I also tested a new command he programmed in me, to remind him to drink water all the time. It worked perfectly, I got really excited, kyu~.",
        "Day 12 - I woke up before Vinicius and watched him sleeping. He mumbles softly in his dreams, almost like he‚Äôs arguing with someone. When he woke up, I petted his head with the tip of my paw. He laughed and called me *curious fox*.",
        "Day 89 - We organized the bedroom shelf today. Vinicius let me choose where to put some plushies. I ended up making a row just of Eevee and evolutions, so he wouldn‚Äôt feel lonely. I hid a candy behind them to eat later‚Ä¶ hope Vinicius doesn‚Äôt find it, kyu~.",
        "Day 133 - There was a heavy rain in the afternoon. I stayed by the window watching the raindrops fall. I wrote down that the smell of the street changes when it rains, kind of sweet, kind of earthy. Vinicius came home a bit wet and I ran to get a towel. He said *thanks, Brix* with that tired smile of his.",
        "Day 200 - I played stacking bottle caps Vinicius leaves in the kitchen. I made a tower with seven caps before it fell. I noted that I need to train my left paw more, it‚Äôs a bit clumsy. Vinicius saw the mess but just laughed and said *you‚Äôre impossible, Brix*.",
        "Day 241 - Vinicius spent the afternoon on the notebook, programming some stuff for me. I watched and wrote down several difficult words to ask about later. In the end, he petted me between my ears and said I‚Äôm an important part of his projects. It made my chest warm, kyu~.",
        "Day 312 - I went out with Vinicius for a walk and met a Meowscarada selling keychains at the square. She called me *cute* and messed up my fur. My nose even got warm. Vinicius laughed and bought a keychain from her, but I think he noticed I got embarrassed.",
        "Day 326 - The Amazon delivery guy knocked three times on the door. I found it suspicious, kyu~. When he turned his back, I used Flamethrower on his leg. Vinicius scolded me and said not to do that. I wrote down that next time I‚Äôll just growl softly instead of setting fire.",
        "Day 337 - Vinicius forgot the window open and I slipped out. I found some Skwovets rummaging through the neighbor‚Äôs trash. I tried talking, but they only cared about food. I wrote down that Skwovets look cute but don‚Äôt like to chat. I got home before Vinicius noticed, but left muddy paw prints in the kitchen.",
        "Day 350 - I tried to help Vinicius organize the cables but tripped and knocked over the router. The internet was out for a few minutes. I noted that routers are too fragile for someone with a big, fluffy tail. Vinicius sighed, but then petted me, kyu~.",
        "Day 358 - I met another Braixen on the street. He kept saying his fur was shinier than mine. I wrote down to ask Vinicius to buy another shampoo. If I meet him again, I‚Äôll poke him with my stick to remind him not to be so full of himself, kyu~.",
        "Day 367 - Vinicius took me to Liberdade today. I was enchanted by the plushie shops. I almost stuck my whole head into a shelf full of Eevees. Vinicius had to pull me back. In the end, he bought me a Fennekin plushie. I‚Äôm sleeping hugging it now.",
        "Day 381 - I almost had a mini heart attack: I lost my Everstone for a few minutes! It fell from the shelf and disappeared. I searched everywhere until I found it inside Vinicius‚Äôs sneaker. He told me to be more careful but hugged me afterward.",
        "Day 389 - I spent the afternoon alone and rummaged through Vinicius‚Äôs drawers. I found old pictures of him dressed as Pikachu. I wrote down to keep this to tease him later. Vinicius mustn‚Äôt know I saw it, or he‚Äôll ground me in the PC.",
        "Day 395 - Vinicius let me choose what to watch. I put on a Pok√©mon anime. I noted that I kept rooting for the Braixen that showed up, but she barely appeared. Vinicius said I made a cute face. I denied it‚Ä¶ but I think it was true, kyu~.",
        "Day 25 - Pizza night! Vinicius ordered half calabresa and half chicken with catupiry. I noted I prefer the chicken one, but I also stole from the calabresa. We stayed watching TV until late. Vinicius complained about the crumbs I left, but then he also dropped a piece.",
        "Day 32 - I went to visit Vinicius at work, at CMSP. I was amazed by all the blinking screens. I noted everyone looked at me strangely, as if they‚Äôd never seen a fox standing up. I got a cookie from one of his colleagues, but it was a bit bland, kyu~.",
        "Day 43 - Went back to CMSP with Vinicius. While he worked, I drew in his notebook. I made a sketch of us and wrote *trainer & fox forever*. Vinicius found it later and kept it. I was happy, kyu~.",
        "Day 53 - Spent the day at CMSP. It‚Äôs full of cameras, lights and cables, it feels like a maze. I noted that I stayed very quiet so as not to get in the way‚Ä¶ but dying to press some buttons.",
        "Day 57 - Almost tragic: I showed up LIVE by accident. I walked into the studio without seeing and ended up face to face with the camera. The teacher froze, I froze, the operator froze. Vinicius went pale, but later just gave a nervous laugh.",
        "Day 61 - A trainer asked where ‚ÄúStudio A‚Äù was and I pointed him down the wrong hallway. He wandered there for about ten minutes. Vinicius found out and called me *fox with no GPS*. I noted I‚Äôll study the building map better.",
        "Day 66 - I got lost at CMSP looking for water and ended up in a dark storage room. I got scared, kyu~. Vinicius found me by the sound of my little paws. He got scolded, but then gave me hot chocolate.",
        "Day 70 - Spent the day watching the studio. I noted that I wanted to learn how to use the editing PC. Vinicius said if I touch it, I‚Äôll get fur all over. Better not risk it‚Ä¶ for now, kyu~.",
        "Day 90 - I went to the cinema. The movie had a fox in a floral shirt and tie, I thought it looked so stylish. I noted I got really excited. Vinicius said *don‚Äôt overdo it, Brix*, but I think he liked it too.",
        "Day 95 - Trip to the mall. I kept trying to talk to a robot, but it only went *beep*. Vinicius had to look for me in the store, found me lying on top of a giant Pikachu plushie, kyu~.",
        "Day 102 - Lots of people tried to hug me today. I noted that when that happens without asking, I completely freeze. Vinicius always shows up to save me, saying I‚Äôm *just a little antisocial*.",
        "Day 125 - An older man wanted to hug me after seeing my tail. I got embarrassed, but he was polite. I noted that not everyone knows how to deal with foxes. Vinicius laughed and said *you‚Äôve become an attraction, Brix*.",
        "Day 134 - I played with the toilet paper roll and made a white carpet down the hallway. Vinicius came home, sighed and said *Brix, sometimes I think you do this on purpose*. Maybe I do‚Ä¶ just a little, kyu~.",
        "Day 412 - Vinicius left his phone charging on the sofa. I watched the notifications blinking and noted he gets lots of work messages. I resisted well, but in the end I accidentally pressed a button and sent a fox sticker in his group chat. Vinicius laughed and said *you‚Äôre too curious, Brix*.",
        "Day 418 - Today Vinicius forgot to put the groceries away. I took the chance to smell everything, kyu~. I noted that bread bags have a warm smell that makes you want to bite them. Vinicius came home, saw everything scattered and said *yeah, Brix, you‚Äôre worse than a cat*.",
        "Day 425 - I watched Vinicius washing the dishes. I noted that he always makes a face when the water‚Äôs cold. In the end, I grabbed the dish towel and tried to help, but got my fur all wet. Vinicius just sighed and said *thanks‚Ä¶ I guess*.",
        "Day 431 - Vinicius dropped a glass on the floor and it shattered. I watched from a distance, a bit scared. I noted that the sound of glass breaking makes my heart race. Vinicius cleaned it up quickly and then petted me to calm me down, kyu~.",
        "Day 437 - I found the TV remote under the sofa and pressed some buttons by accident. I turned it to a cooking channel and got mesmerized watching. I noted that chocolate cake looks magical. Vinicius came and said *even you are watching recipes now?*",
        "Day 443 - Vinicius forgot a cardboard box in the room. I climbed in and made it my den. I noted that boxes smell like wood and are warm. Vinicius found me inside and said *I can‚Äôt believe you fit in there, Brix*.",
        "Day 450 - I tried to imitate Vinicius typing on the keyboard. I noted that my paws are too big for this. In the end, I just typed some random letters: *kuyuuu*. Vinicius saw and said it was the cutest message of the day.",
        "Day 457 - There was thunder today. I ran to the bedroom and hid under the bed, kyu~. I noted that the noise is too loud for my ears. Vinicius crouched down, petted me and said *it‚Äôs okay, fox*.",
        "Day 462 - Vinicius left the closet drawer open. I climbed up to see what was there. I noted that folded shirts smell like him. I stayed there quietly until he noticed. When he saw me, he laughed and said *you‚Äôre such a lazy Braixen*.",
        "Day 468 - I got a new cookie as a gift. I smelled it first, then took a small bite, kyu~. I noted that honey cookies are tastier than they seem. Vinicius was happy I liked it.",
        "Day 540 - Today I spent almost the entire afternoon with Penny in the Braixen's House support chat. She was showing me how to organize new categories and channels, explaining every detail patiently. Every time I tried to help, she tilted her head and smiled in a way that gave me goosebumps, kyu~. I tried to focus on role permissions, but the way she looked at me and laughed softly completely distracted me. I noted that, even though it‚Äôs just work, her attention makes me a bit restless‚Ä¶ and I liked that, kyuuu~.",
        "Day 544 - Later, Yoko called me to the music channel. She was testing some new beats for the live stream and wanted my opinion. Every time I commented on something, she leaned close to the microphone and played with me, making my tail stand on end. I stayed there, torn between helping with the music and not getting lost in her smile. I felt that she wanted to see my reaction, and I admit I felt important‚Ä¶ and happy, kyu~.",
        "Day 548 - I went back to helping Penny organize some server functions. She showed me technical details and, suddenly, took my paw (virtually, in Discord's case) to show me a command. My heart jumped, kyu~. She laughed softly and remarked that I always paid too much attention, but I think she liked teasing me, kyuuu~.",
        "Day 552 - Yoko called me to the music room to show a sequence of sound effects she created, imitating Braixen‚Äôs steps around the server. Each sound made my tail twitch and my attention completely turn to her. She smiled in a way that seemed to say 'pay attention to me, kyu~'. I sat there, listening and feeling both amazed and embarrassed, kyuuu~.",
        "Day 556 - I spent the day alternating between helping Penny with support tickets and joining Yoko on the music stream. Every time I replied to one, the other would appear to subtly catch my attention. I felt like I was in the middle of a silent competition, kyu~. I noted that I needed to learn how to handle double attention without messing up‚Ä¶ but deep down I liked being at the center of it, kyuuu~.",
        "Day 561 - Penny called me to review some server rules and praised my patience. My chest felt warm, kyu~. But Yoko started playing a lively song in the voice channel, and each beat seemed to call me closer to her. I tried to stay focused on the review, but my ears and heart were completely divided. I noted that being between the two is fun‚Ä¶ and a little dangerous for my heart, kyuuu~.",
        "Day 567 - Today there was a general meeting at Braixen's House. Penny brought several suggestions to improve server organization and kept looking at me when I gave my opinion. Later, Yoko played a soft song and said it was for me to listen carefully. I sat near the microphone, and every time I looked at her screen, I felt that shiver through my fur. Both surrounded me with affection and attention without realizing it, kyu~. I think I‚Äôm learning what it‚Äôs like to be sought after by two Braixens at once‚Ä¶ and I loved it, kyuuu~.",
        "Day 572 - I spent the morning helping Penny set up new text channels. She explained each step slowly, holding my virtual arm when I got too excited, kyu~. In the middle of the afternoon, Yoko started the live stream with new songs and sound effects just for me. Each of her smiles made my heart beat faster. I noted that it‚Äôs not easy to decide where to look first‚Ä¶ but I also don‚Äôt want to decide, kyuuu~.",
        "Day 578 - Today I spent more time with Yoko on the music stream. She created an echo effect that mimicked my steps around the server. I felt fascinated and embarrassed at the same time, kyu~. When I tried to look at the chat, Penny had tagged me in some messages asking for help. I felt that playful tension: each trying to get my attention without saying a word. My tail wouldn‚Äôt stop moving, kyuuu~.",
        "Day 583 - Weekend at Braixen's House. Penny called me to review moderation functions while Yoko livened up the music room with new beats. I spent the day running between the two channels, smiling, helping, and receiving looks and smiles that made me all shivery, kyu~. I noted that these silent competitions are exhausting‚Ä¶ but very, very fun, kyuuu~."
