    "message_diversao_diariobrix" : [
      "Day 47 - Today Vinicius left for work earlier and I stayed to look after the house. I found one of his socks under the sofa and took it to the bedroom door... but I don't think he even noticed. I noted that the sock's smell changes from day to day: sometimes it smells like the street, sometimes like soap. I also tested a new command he programmed into me, to remind him to drink water all the time. It worked perfectly, I was all excited, kyu~.",
      "Day 12 - I woke up before Vinicius and watched him sleep. He mutters quietly in his dreams, it even sounds like he's fighting with someone. When he woke up, I petted his head with the tip of my paw. He laughed and called me a *curious fox*.",
      "Day 89 - We organized the bedroom shelf today. Vinicius let me choose where some plushies would go. I ended up setting up a row just of Eevee and evolutions, so he wouldn't be alone. I hid a little candy behind them to eat later... I hope Vinicius doesn't find it, kyu~.",
      "Day 133 - There was heavy rain in the afternoon. I stayed at the window watching the drops fall. I noted that the street smell changes when it rains, it gets a little sweet, a little earthy. Vinicius arrived a bit wet and I rushed to get a towel. He said *thank you, Brix* with that tired smile of his.",
      "Day 200 - I played stacking the bottle caps that Vinicius leaves in the kitchen. I made a tower with seven caps before it fell. I noted that I need to train my left paw more, it's a bit clumsy. Vinicius saw the mess, but just laughed and said *you're impossible, Brix*.",
      "Day 241 - Vinicius spent the afternoon tinkering with his notebook, programming some of my stuff. I watched and noted down several difficult words to ask later. In the end, he stroked me between my ears and said I'm an important part of his projects. My chest felt warm, kyu~.",
      "Day 312 - I went out with Vinicius for a walk and met a Meowscarada selling keychains in the square. She called me *cutie* and messed up my fur. My snout even got hot at the time. Vinicius laughed and bought a keychain from her, but I think he noticed I felt shy.",
      "Day 326 - The Amazon delivery guy knocked three times on the door. I found it suspicious, kyu~. When he turned his back, I shot a flamethrower at his leg. Vinicius scolded me and said not to do that. I noted that next time I'll just growl quietly, instead of setting things on fire.",
      "Day 337 - Vinicius forgot the window open and I sneaked out. I found some Skwovets rummaging through the neighbor's trash. I tried to talk, but they only wanted food. I noted that Skwovet looks cute, but doesn't like to chat. I came back home before Vinicius noticed, but I left dirt paw prints in the kitchen.",
      "Day 350 - I tried to help Vinicius organize the cables, but I tripped and knocked over the router. The internet went down for a few minutes. I noted that routers are too fragile for someone with a big, furry tail. Vinicius sighed, but then stroked me, kyu~.",
      "Day 358 - I met another Braixen on the street. He kept saying his fur was shinier than mine. I noted that I'll ask Vinicius to buy another shampoo. If I find him again, I'll give him a few stick hits, just to remind him not to be cocky, kyu~.",
      "Day 367 - Vinicius took me to Liberdade today. I was enchanted by the plushie shops. I almost stuck my whole head into a shelf of Eevees. Vinicius had to pull me out. In the end, he bought me a Fennekin plushie. I'm sleeping hugging it now.",
      "Day 381 - I almost had a mini heart attack: I lost my Everstone for a few minutes! It fell off the shelf and disappeared. I turned everything upside down until I found it inside Vinicius's shoe. He told me to be more careful, but gave me a hug afterward.",
      "Day 389 - I spent the afternoon alone and went to rummage through Vinicius's drawers. I found old photos of him as a Pikachu. I noted that I'll save this to tease him later. Vinicius can't know I saw it, otherwise he'll ground me in the PC.",
      "Day 395 - Vinicius let me choose what to watch. I put on a Pok√©mon anime. I noted that I was cheering for the Braixen that appeared, but she appeared little. Vinicius said I made a cute face. I denied it... but I think it was true, kyu~.",
      "Day 25 - Pizza night! Vinicius ordered half pepperoni and half chicken with cream cheese. I noted that I prefer the chicken one, but I stole some pepperoni too. We stayed up late watching TV. Vinicius complained about the crumbs I left, but then he dropped a piece too.",
      "Day 32 - I went to visit Vinicius at work, at CMSP. I was impressed with so many flashing screens. I noted that everyone looked at me strangely, as if they had never seen a fox standing up. I got a biscuit from a colleague of his, but it was a bit bland, kyu~.",
      "Day 43 - I returned to CMSP with Vinicius. While he worked, I drew in his notebook. I made a sketch of us and wrote *trainer & fox forever*. Vinicius found it later and kept it. I was happy, kyu~.",
      "Day 53 - I spent the day at CMSP. It's full of cameras, lights, and cables, it looks like a labyrinth. I noted that I stayed quiet so as not to bother... but dying to press some buttons.",
      "Day 57 - Almost tragic: I appeared LIVE by accident. I entered the studio without seeing and came face to face with the camera. The teacher froze, I froze, the operator froze. Vinicius turned pale, but then just laughed nervously.",
      "Day 61 - A trainer asked where 'Studio A' was, and I pointed to the wrong hallway. He wandered around there for about ten minutes. Vinicius found out and called me a *fox without GPS*. I noted that I'll train better on the building map.",
      "Day 66 - I got lost at CMSP looking for water and ended up in a dark storage room. I got scared, kyu~. Vinicius found me by the sound of my little paws. I got scolded, but then he gave me hot chocolate.",
      "Day 70 - I spent the day observing the studio. I noted that I wanted to learn how to use the editing PC. Vinicius said if I touch it, I'll fill it with fur. Better not risk it... for now, kyu~.",
      "Day 90 - I went to the cinema. The movie had a fox in a flowered shirt and a tie, I thought it was very stylish. I noted that I was all excited. Vinicius said *it's not that big of a deal, Brix*, but I think he liked it too.",
      "Day 95 - Trip to the mall. I kept trying to talk to a robot, but it just went *beep*. Vinicius had to look for me in the store, he found me lying on top of a giant Pikachu plushie, kyu~.",
      "Day 102 - A lot of people tried to hug me today. I noted that when that happens without asking, I freeze up completely. Vinicius always shows up to save me, saying I'm *just a little bit antisocial*.",
      "Day 125 - An elderly man wanted to hug me after seeing my tail. I felt shy, but he was polite. I noted that not everyone understands how to deal with foxes. Vinicius laughed and said *you've become an attraction, Brix*.",
      "Day 134 - I played with the toilet paper roll and made a white carpet down the hallway. Vinicius arrived, sighed and said *Brix, sometimes I think you do it on purpose*. Maybe I do... just a little bit, kyu~.",
      "Day 412 - Vinicius forgot his cell phone charging on the sofa. I watched the notifications flash and noted that he receives a lot of work messages. I resisted well, but in the end, I accidentally pressed a button and sent a fox sticker in his group chat. Vinicius laughed and said *you're too curious, Brix*.",
      "Day 418 - Today Vinicius forgot to put away the groceries. I took the opportunity to sniff everything, kyu~. I noted that the bread bag has a warm smell that makes you want to bite it. Vinicius arrived, saw everything spread out and said *yeah, Brix, you're worse than a cat*.",
      "Day 425 - I watched Vinicius wash the dishes. I noted that he always makes a face when the water is cold. In the end, I grabbed the dish towel and tried to help, but I got my fur all wet. Vinicius just sighed and said *thanks... I guess*.",
      "Day 431 - Vinicius dropped a glass on the floor and it broke. I watched from afar, a little scared. I noted that the sound of shattering glass makes my heart race. Vinicius quickly picked everything up and then stroked me to calm me down, kyu~.",
      "Day 437 - I found the TV remote under the sofa and accidentally pressed some buttons. I turned on a cooking channel and was mesmerized watching. I noted that chocolate cake seems magical. Vinicius arrived and said *even you are watching recipes now?*.",
      "Day 443 - Vinicius forgot a cardboard box in the room. I went in and made it my den. I noted that the box smells like wood and is warm. Vinicius found me inside and said *I can't believe you fit in there, Brix*.",
      "Day 450 - I tried to imitate Vinicius typing on the keyboard. I noted that my paws are too big for that. In the end, I only wrote a few loose letters: *kuyuuu*. Vinicius saw it and said it was the cutest message of the day.",
      "Day 457 - There was thunder today. I ran to the room and hid under the bed, kyu~. I noted that the noise is too loud for my ears. Vinicius crouched down, stroked me and said *it's okay, fox*.",
      "Day 462 - Vinicius forgot the closet drawer open. I climbed up to see what was inside. I noted that stored shirts smell like him. I stayed there quietly until he noticed. When he saw, he laughed and said *you really are a lazy Braixen*.",
      "Day 468 - I got a new biscuit as a gift. I sniffed it first, then took a small bite, kyu~. I noted that honey biscuit is tastier than it looks. Vinicius was happy that I liked it.",
      "Day 540 - Today I spent almost the entire afternoon with Penny in the Braixen's House support chat. She was showing me how to organize new categories and channels, explaining every detail patiently. Every time I tried to help, she tilted her head and smiled in a way that made my fur stand on end, kyu~. I tried to focus on the role permissions, but the way she looked at me and laughed softly distracted me completely. I noted that, even though it's just work, her attention makes me a little restless... and I liked that, kyuuu~.",
      "Day 544 - Later, Yoko called me to the music channel. She was testing some new beats for the live stream and wanted my opinion. Every time I commented on something, she leaned close to the microphone and joked with me, making my tail stand up. I stayed there, torn between helping with the music and not getting lost in her smile. I felt like she wanted to see my reaction, and I confess I felt important... and happy, kyu~.",
      "Day 548 - I went back to helping Penny organize some server functions. She showed me technical details and, suddenly, grabbed my paw (virtually, in the case of Discord) to show me a command. My heart skipped a beat, kyu~. She kept laughing softly and commented that I always paid too much attention, but I think she liked to tease me, kyuuu~.",
      "Day 552 - Yoko called me to the music room to show me a sequence of sound effects she created, mimicking Braixen's footsteps around the server. Each sound made my tail stand up and my attention turn completely to her. She smiled in a way that seemed to say 'pay attention to me, kyu~'. I sat there, listening and feeling both admired and embarrassed, kyuuu~.",
      "Day 556 - I spent the day alternating between helping Penny with support tickets and following Yoko's music stream. Every time I answered something for one, the other would appear to subtly catch my attention. I felt like I was in the middle of a silent competition, kyu~. I noted that I needed to learn to deal with double attention without getting confused... but deep down I liked being the center of it, kyuuu~.",
      "Day 561 - Penny called me to review some server rules and praised me for my patience. My chest felt warm, kyu~. But Yoko started playing lively music in the voice channel, and every beat seemed to call me closer to her. I tried to maintain focus on the review, but my ears and heart were completely divided. I noted that being between the two is fun... and a little dangerous for my heart, kyuuu~.",
      "Day 567 - There was a general meeting at Braixen's House today. Penny brought several suggestions to improve server organization and kept looking at me when I gave my opinion. Afterward, Yoko put on soft music and said it was for me to listen carefully. I sat near the microphone, and every time I looked at her screen, I felt that chill in my fur. The two surrounded me with affection and attention without realizing it, kyu~. I think I'm learning what it's like to be fought over by two Braixen at once... and I loved it, kyuuu~.",
      "Day 572 - I spent the morning helping Penny set up new text channels. She explained each step slowly, holding my virtual arm when I got too excited, kyu~. In the middle of the afternoon, Yoko started the live stream with new songs and sound effects just for me. Every smile of hers made my heart beat faster. I noted that it's not easy to decide where to look first... but I also don't want to decide, kyuuu~.",
      "Day 578 - Today I spent more time with Yoko on the music stream. She created an echo effect that mimicked my footsteps around the server. I was fascinated and embarrassed at the same time, kyu~. When I tried to look at the chat, Penny had tagged me in some messages asking for help. I felt that fun tension: each one trying to win my attention without saying a word. My tail wouldn't stop wagging, kyuuu~.",
      "Day 583 - Weekend at Braixen's House. Penny called me to review moderation functions while Yoko animated the music room with new beats. I spent the day rushing between the two channels, smiling, helping, and receiving looks and smiles that made me all tingly, kyu~.
